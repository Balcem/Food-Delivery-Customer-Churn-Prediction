# 🍔 Food Delivery Customer Churn Prediction

**End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Predicting Customer Churn using MLflow and FastAPI**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project builds a full-stack machine learning system to predict customer churn for a food delivery platform. It includes **data exploration, feature engineering, model training, experiment tracking with MLflow, and real-time prediction via FastAPI**.  

The goal is to help businesses **retain customers**, understand behavior patterns, and improve service quality.

---

## **Problem Statement**

Customer churn is a critical metric for subscription and service-based businesses. Predicting which customers are likely to stop using the platform enables targeted retention strategies, increasing revenue and customer satisfaction.

---

## **Project Objectives**

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and extract insights about customer behavior.  
- Engineer meaningful features (RFM, behavioral, temporal, loyalty, and service quality).  
- Build a **robust ML pipeline** with preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- Track experiments and compare models with **MLflow**.  
- Deploy the best model using **FastAPI** for real-time predictions.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Python** – main programming language  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – data analysis & visualization  
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** – machine learning models  
- **MLflow** – experiment tracking & model management  
- **FastAPI** – API deployment for real-time predictions  
- **Pydantic** – input/output data validation  
- **Docker (optional)** – containerization for deployment
